Typing Speed Test Application (Python)

📘 Overview

The Typing Speed Test Application is a GUI-based desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter.
It evaluates a user’s typing performance by measuring typing speed (Words Per Minute – WPM), accuracy, and error count within a fixed time limit.

The application displays a paragraph at the top of the interface. Users must type the paragraph by observing it, without copying. During typing, correct characters are highlighted in green and incorrect characters are highlighted in red, providing clear real-time visual feedback.

This project is designed for University-level coursework and demonstrates the practical application of GUI programming, timing mechanisms, and statistical analysis.

💻 System Requirements

Hardware

- Any standard computer or laptop

Software

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

📐 Mathematical Calculations

Words Per Minute (WPM)

WPM = (Total Words Typed / Time in Seconds) × 60

Accuracy (%)

Accuracy = (Correct Characters / Total Characters) × 100

Errors

Errors = Total Characters − Correct Characters
